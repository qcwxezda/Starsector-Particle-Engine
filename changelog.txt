0.9.3:
- Fixed issue where title screen wasn't being counted as a combat screen.

0.9.2:
- Now uses sprite.getTexWidth and sprite.getTexHeight added in Starsector 0.98.
- Fallback to default particle if a sprite with a null texture is passed in.

0.9.1:
- No longer holds onto a CombatEngineAPI instance (potential for memory leaks).
- (12:10 PM EST 5/26/2025) Changed license to LGPL (more permissive).

0.9.0:
- Now supports creating particles in the campaign layer.
- IEmitter:
    - added CampaignEngineLayers getCampaignLayer(), the layer the particles should be rendered to if called in the campaign layer.
    - added boolean isAlwaysRenderInCampaign(), set this to true to persist particles through campaign screen transitions.
- Can now call burst and stream directly from the emitter instead of having to go through Particles.
- Numerous under-the-hood changes to more efficiently support campaign rendering, (hopefully) doesn't break anything.
- No longer unloads loaded textures to prevent possible conflicts in case, e.g. Particle Engine loads a texture, another mod loads it later, then Particle Engine unloads it after it's done using it.
- Note: particles are absolutely *not* stored in the save file, so they will not persist through a game exit/load cycle.

0.8.0:
- Recompiled for Java 17.
- Changed game version to 0.98a.

0.73:
- Added hard-toggle switch in particleengine.json, turns off all particle effects using this mod while still allowing it to
  run in the mod list.

0.72:
- Updated to 0.97a, no changes.

0.71:

- Fixed default particle falloff, now is actually using square falloff and should look like particlealpha64sq.png in graphics/fx
- Made ParticleData.colorHSVA public
- No longer hard crashes if glMapBufferRange encounters an error, and will log an error message into the console

0.7:

- Added preInitParticles, which is called only once per burst and can be used to avoid re-computation.
- Shader now uses SpriteAPI's textureWidth and textureLength, scaling the image up when they are less than 1.
- Shader now uses SpriteAPI's centerX and centerY if they are non-negative and sticks to using the standard
  (0.5, 0.5) center otherwise.
- Updated dynamic anchoring to also dynamically update the emitter's axis. Note: Particles.anchorEmitter still only anchors
  position, not angle.
- Fixed untextured particles' alpha being capped to 0.25.
- Removed multiple extraneous getLocation calls when adding particle data to a float buffer
- Halved maximum simultaneous active dynamic emitters, down to 1024 from 2048
- Various optimizations

0.62:

- Fixed an issue where dynamically tracked particles could be jittery on their first frame.
- Fixed a bug where the wrong emitters were being evicted when the tracked emitter buffer was full.
- Greatly optimized the tracked emitter buffer handler. It now no longer holds on to stale emitters longer than necessary
  and only binds the UBO data each frame up to its maximum used index.

0.61:

- Hotfix a crash when doWhenFinished is null
- Fixed an issue where streams were finishing when they weren't supposed to
- Fixed an issue where streams would no longer generate more than 1 burst per frame
- Changed maxDuration in Particles.stream back to float from Float, set to negative value to never expire

0.6:

- Added anchorEmitter to Particles, which automates the task of setting the emitter's location to a combat entity's location
  each frame as well as destroying streams when the anchored-to combat entity leaves play.
- Added the ability to dynamically anchor particles to their emitters, allowing them to track and follow changes
  in their emitters' locations. Applied on a per-emitter basis, using enableDynamicAnchoring.
  Useful for particles that are meant to follow a combat entity.
  - Note: emitter locations are stored in a UBO. Due to buffer size limitations, a maximum of 2048 emitters' locations
    can be tracked at a time. If more than 2048 emitters are being tracked, stale ones will start to be deleted. Use
    disableDynamicAnchoring to free an emitter's slot in the buffer.
- Added an optional doWhenFinished parameter when creating particle streams.
- Particles.stream now takes a Float for maxDuration rather than a float -- set it to null to make a stream never expire
  naturally.
- Particles.stream should now more accurately handle particles per burst, particles per second, and total duration.
- Optimized the particle allocation process a bit; should be less taxing on the CPU.
- Fixed an issue where createCopy was overriding the copy's sprite and blend mode settings

0.5:

- Added new classes, IEmitter and BaseIEmitter, that may be extended to generate custom particle emitters.
  Particles can now depend on each other's properties (prior to generation).
- Generified Particles.StreamAction. Note: this will break implementations using StreamAction, to fix, replace all StreamAction with StreamAction<Emitter>.
- Changed license, relevant for v0.5+

0.4:

- Updated Starsector version to 0.96a-RC6
- Changed default out-of-bounds range from 100 to 500
- Changed default particle layer to ABOVE_PARTICLES_LOWER
- Added early exit on Particles.burst if number of particles is <= 0

0.3:

- Emitters now support CombatEngineLayers, layer can be set via Emitter.setLayer.
- Added Emitter.setInactiveBorder. Emitters outside the screen by more than this amount of world units will ignore particle generation calls.

0.2:

- Added mod thread id to version file
- Removed axis from json output (it's an emitter property, not a particle property)
- Added changing of emitter sprite and blend mode via setters
- Added setSyncSize to Emitter, which allows random particle sizes that are the same in the x and y directions (uses the x direction values)

0.1:

- Initial release
